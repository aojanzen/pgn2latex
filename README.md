# pgn2latex

**pgn2latex** is a command line tool that reads chess games that have been
automatically analyzed by a chess engine, extracts all variants, detects
blunders and faults and creates a LaTeX file that includes the result of the
analysis in a nice, human readable way, including diagrams where severe
mistakes were made.
